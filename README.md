<h1 align="center">What can it do?</h1>

<p align ="center">
NotReaper is equipped with many tools and features to help you make Audica maps exactly how you
want in an as short amount of time as possible. Here's some of the highlights.



</p>

* Direct loading, generating, and exporting of Audica files. No more hassle.
* A responsive and user friendly interface. Complete with 100% more animations.
* Drag all the things with Drag Select, your new best friend. Unless you hate productivity, that is.
* Custom-color responsive UI. Want to have teal and gold notes? You got it, chief.
* Mildly entertaining changelogs.

</p>
<p align="center">
Make your dreams become a reality with the selector that can be dragged.
</p>


* Drag on the Timeline or the Grid to select a bunch of notes.
* Drag them around to reposition, or drag them on the timeline to change their beat position.
* Flip note colors, position horizontally or vertically. It's flipping awesome.
* When you get bored of holding a bunch of notes hostage, deselect them all with a hotkey.
    * What? I'm not a monster, okay?




<h3 align="center">Customization</h3>

Get bored of staring at the same UI over and over? Make NotReaper more like home.
</p>



* Configure what colors you want to use for the Audica targets, and the UI will follow suite.
* Don't like the background? Me neither. Change it to a picture of kittens for a 20% mapping speed increase.
* Custom keybindings! Want to save with Ctrl+C and add notes with L? Be my guest. (soon)



<h1>How the heck do I use this thing</h1>

I ask myself that question everyday. For a comprehensive list of the default hotkeys, hit F1 in-game to pull up a neat page with words and animations on it.

## History

It all began with [Rolopogo](https://github.com/rolopogo), and the [Audica Editor](https://github.com/rolopogo/AudicaEditor). This was also worked on by [CameronBess](https://github.com/CameronBess) and [Wolf](https://github.com/Wolferacing).

Eventually, all development stopped, and the project went dead. CircuitLord took it up and began to rewrite and rebuild the entire project from what had been there originally. Optimizing, organizing, and adding new features. At some point it had changed so much, that it was decided to rename the project to NotReaper, imitating the main mapping tool used for Audica (Reaper).

# Config File

This is the current config file and all possible values. Note that newer versions do not currently write all keys to the file and just use a default so if your config is out of date please check below for some configurable options you may set.

```

COLOR represents an rgba value as { "r": 0-1, "g": 0-1, "b": 0-1, "a": 0-1 }.

{
    "leftColor": { COLOR },                 // left note color, default { "r": 0.0, "g": 0.5, "b": 1.0, "a": 1.0 }
